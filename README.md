# Decentralized AML Whistleblower Network

## Overview
The Decentralized AML Whistleblower Network is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to anonymously submit reports on suspicious activities. These reports are verified by a decentralized jury and, once verified, reward both the whistleblower and the jury members. The platform leverages decentralized technologies such as IPFS, Polygon, and smart contracts to ensure security, transparency, and privacy.

## Features
- **Anonymous Reporting:** Users can submit reports anonymously, ensuring their privacy is protected.
- **Decentralized Verification:** A decentralized jury verifies reports, making the process transparent and impartial.
- **Incentives and Rewards:** Verified reports trigger rewards for both the whistleblower and the jury members.
- **Security:** The platform integrates secure access control and protection against common vulnerabilities.

## Project Structure
The project is structured in a modular way to promote flexibility, maintainability, and security. Below is an overview of the key components:

### Smart Contracts
- **ReportStorage.sol:** Manages the storage of reports on the blockchain.
- **Verification.sol:** Handles the decentralized verification process for reports.
- **RewardDistribution.sol:** Distributes rewards to the whistleblower and the jury members.
- **JurorSelection.sol:** Manages the selection of jurors for each report.
- **AccessControl.sol:** Provides access control and role-based permissions.
- **SafeMath.sol:** Ensures safe mathematical operations to prevent overflows and underflows.

### Technologies Used
- **Blockchain Platform:** Polygon (Ethereum Layer 2)
- **Smart Contract Development:** Solidity, Hardhat
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Ethers.js
- **Data Storage:** IPFS
- **Blockchain Connection:** Alchemy
- **Frontend Development:** React.js or Next.js

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat
- MetaMask (or another Ethereum wallet)
- IPFS CLI

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/decentralized-aml-whistleblower.git
    cd decentralized-aml-whistleblower
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile the smart contracts:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. **Deploy the smart contracts to a local network:**
    ```bash
    npx hardhat node
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
    ```

5. **Start the frontend:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

6. **Configure MetaMask:**
   - Add the local blockchain network to MetaMask.
   - Import the accounts generated by Hardhat into MetaMask.

### Running Tests
To run the test suite, use the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat test
